        <P>"how day will eventually break – who knows? But we can feel the morning. We are no longer moonstruck wanderers roaming dreamily in the plae light of history. A cool early morning wind is blowing around us; he who doesn’t want to shiver must stride out. And we and all those striding with us see in the distance the early light of the awakening morning! Where are all the nocturnal spectres! Glassy and bright a new world shines out in the early light, it is sending out its first rays. A first gleam of jubilant dawn, decades, generations – and the great sun of architecture, of art in gengeral will begin its victorious course.  </P>

<P>The idea of the early light is not mirrored in the series for the first time. It was and is good to maintain our view of the horizon with undimmed imagination. Tests of the realization of the new idea already exist in material, and these pages are inteded first and foremost to serve this realization, starting from the activities of the town council that delight in the furture. They are intended to help our comades in germany strides forward more joyfully with us, and our path will meet those who are our brothers in spirit beyond our frontiers. </P>

<p> We do not believe in parrallels between material and spiritual following. The full stomach does not like ideas, the overfull hates them, it wants peace. Today more than ever we believe in our will, which creates for us the only life value. And this value is: everlasting change."</p>
